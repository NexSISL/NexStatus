## Features

- **Uptime monitoring** — HTTP, TCP, and keyword checks with configurable intervals
- **Confirmatory re-checks** — 2 additional pings before marking a service down (avoids false positives)
- **Incident management** — create, update, and resolve incidents with a full update timeline
- **Announcements** — info, maintenance, and incident banners on the public page
- **Discord integration** — auto-posts and edits embeds in a channel when incidents are created or updated
- **TOTP 2FA** — optional second factor for admin login (RFC 6238 compatible, e.g. Google Authenticator)
- **Appearance customization** — site title, logo, favicon, accent color, background, font family, footer text
- **30-day uptime history** — sparkline graphs and per-day latency history per service
- **Service sections** — group services into sections on the public page
- **Rate limiting** — separate limits for public endpoints, admin endpoints, and auth
- **Setup wizard** — first-run `/setup` page, no manual config file editing required
- **Zero dependencies on external DBs** — all data stored in `data/*.json`

## Stack

- **Backend** — Node.js (ESM), Express
- **Frontend** — Vanilla JS, HTML, CSS (no frameworks)
- **Persistence** — JSON files
- **Auth** — short-lived signed JWT session (`Authorization: Bearer …`) + optional TOTP; the password is only sent to the login endpoint
